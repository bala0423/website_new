				<p>Imagine a future where all the world&prime;s financial institutions are not only transparent, but operating on a open pre-defined rules system that is enforced based on truth. The moment someone disavowing or trying to cheat, the whole world would see. The biggest key to turning blockchain&prime;s potential into reality is a collaborative effort among enterprises to create the network that used by everyone owned or controlled by no-one. Blockchain and distributed ledgers have a exciting role to play in creating a more transparent future.</p>
				
				<p>The promise of cryptofinance is one of trustworthy financial systems. Building these kinds of systems requires new models of trust, and platforms enable all kinds of players irrespective of their size and nature of operation to enter, contribute and benefit. We can build smart contracts over the blockchain backbone that is an ubiquitous distributed ledger system that can transform the way we make transactions.</p>
