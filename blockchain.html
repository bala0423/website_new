<h3 style="padding-left:10px; padding-top:10px;">Blockchain</h3>
<p style="padding:10px;">The biggest key to turning blockchain’s potential into reality is a collaborative effort among enterprises to create the network necessary to support global shared infrastructure. Enterprises need to look at the bigger picture and work together—and with counterparts—to help define the backbone that can underpin a universally accepted, ubiquitous global distributed ledger system that can transform transactions.</p>
<p style="padding:10px;">Blockchain and distributed ledgers have a bright future. As real-time, open-source and trusted platforms that securely transmit data and value, they can help organizations not only reduce the cost of processing, but also create new products and services that can generate important new revenue streams.</p>
