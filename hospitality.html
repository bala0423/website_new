		<div class="contents">
			<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Menu Engineering</span>  was done. While we analyzed the menu along with sales, we were surprised to find out that more than 60% of the dishes had no or negligible sales. These dishes were slashed off the menu so that the kitchen can concentrate on what gets really sold.</p>
				<p style="padding-left:15px; padding-top:5px;"><span style="font-weight:bold;">Demand Vs Time</span> was analyzed and we found out that in certain days of the week the sales were low, hence some offers could be given to increase it and / or employees could be encouraged to take off on those days. We found similar pattern for certain months too.</p>
	
				<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Demand Vs Season</span> was analyzed to see which dishes sold during which season, this helped them in keeping the right amount of stock, thus making their supply chain more efficient.</p>
				
				<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Customer Details</span> along with bill were collected, loyal customers were spotted and rewards were generated automatically as discounts.</p>
				
				<p>Our analysis revealed that some units / restaurants generated more revenue for given investment. Meaning, their <span style="font-weight:bold;">Revenue Generation Index (RGI)</span> were way above others. So the management was asked to look into what made certain units efficient than others and replicate them to improve their returns.</p>
